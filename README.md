Hi there 👋🏻

I’m a frontend developer, currently focusing on React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase and Next. I enjoy building clean, intuitive interfaces with smart UX.

In my free time, I like 3D modeling (my own [projects for 3D printing](https://www.thingiverse.com/antiktuna/designs), and sometimes [environments and props](https://www.artstation.com/antiktuna)). I’m also learning how to play chess.
